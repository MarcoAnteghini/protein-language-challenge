### Project Description
How good can a DL embedding perform in predicting the protein secondary structure?. That is what we analysed participating in the "From protein language to features without alignments" challenge. 
Our team focused on solutions to improve the prediction:
i) modify the weights in the cross-entropy function according to the specific secondary structure frequency in the used training set 
ii) mapping the prediction of the S8 classes to the S3 classes and not perform two separate classifications (thus fastening and improving the process)
iii) re-implement the NetSurfP-2.0 model 
iv) implement a less complex but similar version of NetSurfP-2.0 based on CNN.
